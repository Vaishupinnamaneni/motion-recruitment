Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the given problem on collaborative development using GitHub:

Switch to Main Branch:

Make sure you are on the main/master branch before creating a new branch.
Use the appropriate command to checkout the main branch.
Create a New Branch:

Create a new branch named feature-azure-setup.
This isolates your changes specifically related to the Azure setup.
Add a New File:

In the newly created feature-azure-setup branch, add a new file named azure-setup.md.
This file will document the detailed steps on setting up Azure services.
Document Azure Setup Steps:

Inside azure-setup.md, provide comprehensive instructions for:
Creating an Azure account.
Setting up a basic Azure Virtual Machine (VM).
Deploying a sample Python script that performs a simple task (like adding two numbers).
Commit Changes:

After documenting the necessary steps in azure-setup.md, save the file.
Stage the new file and commit your changes with a descriptive and informative commit message. The message should clearly state the purpose of the commit.
Push to Remote Repository:

Push the changes in the feature-azure-setup branch to the remote repository. This step ensures your branch and its changes are available on the remote server (GitHub).
Create a Pull Request:

On GitHub, navigate to your repository and create a pull request to merge the feature-azure-setup branch into the main branch.
Provide a clear description of the pull request, explaining the changes made and their purpose.
Review and Merge:

Ideally, another team member should review the pull request to ensure the changes are correct and meet the required standards.
If the pull request is approved, merge feature-azure-setup into the main branch using GitHubâ€™s interface.
Resolve Merge Conflicts:

If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them as needed and ensure that the final result in the main branch is complete and correct.
Verification:

After merging, verify that the azure-setup.md file and any associated changes are correctly integrated into the main branch.
Optional: Run any tests or validation scripts to ensure the main branch remains stable and functional.
By following these optimized steps, you can efficiently manage collaborative development tasks using Git and GitHub, ensuring your workflow is seamless and well-organized.
