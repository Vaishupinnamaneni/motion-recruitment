Sure, here is a step-by-step approach to solve the given problem:

Switch to Main Branch:

Ensure you are on the main/master branch before creating a new branch.
Use the appropriate command to switch to the main branch.
Create a New Branch:

Create a new branch named feature-aws-setup.
This will allow you to make changes related to the AWS setup in isolation without affecting the main branch.
Add a New File:

In the newly created branch, add a new file named aws-setup.md.
This file will document the steps required to create an AWS account, set up a basic EC2 instance, and deploy a sample Python script.
Document AWS Setup Steps:

Inside aws-setup.md, provide detailed steps for:
Creating an AWS account.
Setting up a basic EC2 instance.
Deploying a sample Python script that performs a simple task   (like adding two numbers).
  
Commit Changes:

After adding the required documentation to aws-setup.md, save the changes.
Stage the new file and commit the changes with an appropriate and descriptive commit message. This helps others understand the purpose of the changes made.
Switch Back to Main Branch:

Once the changes are committed, switch back to the main branch to prepare for merging the new feature branch.
Merge the Feature Branch:

Merge the feature-aws-setup branch into the main branch. Ensure that the merge is handled properly to incorporate all the changes.
Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise during the merging process.
Verify the Merge:

After merging, verify that aws-setup.md and the corresponding updates have been successfully integrated into the main branch.
Optionally, run any tests or validations to ensure the integrity of the main branch post-merge.
By following these steps, you should be able to handle branching and merging tasks efficiently, ensuring a clean and organized workflow suitable for competitive programming or collaborative projects.
