Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve the given problem on deploying to GCP with collaborative development using GitHub:

Task: GCP Deployment and Collaborative Development with GitHub
Ensure You Are on the Main Branch

Check out the main branch of your repository to ensure you're starting from a baseline state.
Use the appropriate Git command to switch to the main branch if required.
Create a New Branch Named feature-gcp-setup

Create a dedicated branch for the GCP setup to isolate these changes from the main branch.
Use the command to create and switch to the new branch.
Add a New File Named gcp-setup.md

In the feature-gcp-setup branch, create a new file called gcp-setup.md.
This file will be where you document the detailed steps for setting up GCP services.
Document GCP Setup Steps in gcp-setup.md

Inside the gcp-setup.md file, provide comprehensive instructions on:
Creating a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
Setting up a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance.
Deploying a sample Python script that adds two numbers.
Detailed Steps to Include:
Create a GCP Account:

Visit the Google Cloud Platform website.
Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.
Complete any necessary verification steps and set up billing information (consider using the free tier for initial testing).
Set Up a Google Compute Engine Instance:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to the "Compute Engine" section.
Create a new VM instance:
Choose the appropriate machine type and configuration.
Configure firewall rules to allow SSH access.
Start the VM and take note of the SSH connection details.
Deploy a Sample Python Script:

SSH into the VM using the connection details provided.
Ensure Python is installed on the VM; install it if necessary.
Create a simple Python script that adds two numbers and save it, for example, add_numbers.py.
Run the Python script to verify it executes correctly.
Commit Changes with a Clear Message

Save the gcp-setup.md file after documenting the steps.
Stage the file and commit your changes with a detailed and clear commit message explaining the purpose of the changes (e.g., "Add documentation for GCP account setup, GCE instance creation, and Python script deployment").
Push Changes to the Remote Repository

Push the feature-gcp-setup branch to your remote GitHub repository.
This ensures that your changes are available in the remote repository and can be accessed by collaborators.
Create a Pull Request

On GitHub, navigate to your repository and create a pull request to merge the feature-gcp-setup branch into the main branch.
Include a detailed description of the changes made in the pull request to provide context to reviewers.
Add a Collaborator to Review the Pull Request

Add a collaborator to review your pull request.
Ensure you address any feedback or suggestions provided by the reviewer to improve or correct the documentation or process.
Address Feedback and Merge

Make any necessary updates to your branch based on the feedback from the reviewer.
Once all feedback has been addressed and the pull request is approved, proceed to merge the feature-gcp-setup branch into the main branch.
Verify the Merge

After merging, verify that the gcp-setup.md file and related updates are correctly integrated into the main branch.
Ensure that the main branch remains functional and that the documentation is clear and complete.
By following these detailed steps, you’ll be able to efficiently handle GCP deployment and collaborative development using GitHub, ensuring a well-organized and clear workflow.
